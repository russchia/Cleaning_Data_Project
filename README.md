# Cleaning_Data_Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Project Description

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

What you find in this repository

    CodeBook.md: information about raw and tidy data set and elaboration made to transform them
    README.md: this file
    run_analysis.R: R script to transform raw data set in a tidy one

How to create the tidy data set

    
    Clone this repository
    Download the data set and extract. It should result in a UCI HAR Dataset folder that has all the files in the required structure.
    Run Rscript <path to>/run_analysis.R
    The tidy dataset should get created in the current directory as tidyData.txt
    Code book for the tidy dataset is available.
